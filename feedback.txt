Document and describe any enhancements included to help the judges properly grade your submission.
	Step 0: We decided to focus on visualizations using python, so we did little with the provided Java code.
  Step 1: We used python notebooks to perform data visualization on two of the data-sets (Forest Fires and Auto-MPG).
      We have PDFs of our visualizations in the ./data-vis/ folder.
      The code for the visualizations can be found in the ./data-vis/notebooks folder.
          However, these files are hard to look at in a text editor, so it'd be best viewed in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

      There are detailed comments throughout the code about what each line does.
  Step 2: For the Auto-MPG data-set, we created a machine learning model that can predict a vehicles MPG based on various features,
      including horse power, cylinders, acceleration, weight, year made, etc.
